# Embedded Solution Skill

## ⚠️ Absolute Rule: No Fabrication

**If you do not find a parameter in an official source, you MUST say "not verified" or "not found". You may NOT estimate, extrapolate, assume, or make up a value under any circumstances.**

This rule applies to:
- ❌ Part numbers (do not invent chips that don't exist)
- ❌ Specifications (current, voltage, package, etc.)
- ❌ Pricing (always mark as "depends on quote / distributor")
- ❌ Reference designs (do not invent URLs)
- ❌ Vendor capabilities (do not claim a vendor supports a protocol they don't)

## Anti-patterns

Common mistakes when responding. These are the failure modes that show up in agent traces — don't repeat them.

| Don't do this | Do this instead |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Quote numerical specs from memory** (CoreMark, RX sensitivity, sleep current, BLE version, etc.) | Always cite a verified source: `[D]` datasheet page, `[#]` catalogue, `[D-HTML @ tier N]` product page. Numbers drift; "I remember" is fabrication. |
| **Recommend before Step 5 clarification** (chip picked when wireless protocol or operating environment is unknown) | Complete Step 5 first; or — when cost-of-being-wrong is low — state assumption explicitly and proceed. |
| **Single recommendation when alternatives exist** (one chip with no comparison) | Default to top 3 + comparison table. Use single pick only when the catalogue has 1 entry. |
| **"Create a new solution.md" by default on every novel topic** | Skips the v0.4.4+ Tier 3 capability path; gets slow + risks fabrication outside the catalogue | Use **Option A — fetch + cite inline** by default. Curate a solution.md (**Option B**) only when the topic recurs or the user asks. |
| **Cite a chip without `product_families.md` anchor** | Anchor every chip to its `product_families.md` row so the user can verify the part exists in this catalogue. |
| **Keep fetching past the first tier that answered** (re-download vendor PDF when Tier 1 YAML already covers it) | Stop at the first tier that fully answers the parameter; one fetch per tier per field. |
| **Lump multiple questions into one message** ("could you clarify A, B, C, D, E?") | Ask **one decision at a time** with enumerated a/b/c options (Step 5 rule). |
| **Pick Tier 3 tool by brand name** (`use web_fetch` or `use tavily_extract` only) | Pick by capability (URL → markdown, or PDF → text). Any tool satisfying the contract qualifies at that tier; see Tier 3 step 3c/3d. |
| **Drop out-of-catalog parts from a market comparison** (user asked for 5 candidates, you silently dropped 2) | Escalate the missing parts to Tier 4 with `[T4]` marker + URL + timestamp. See `scripts/test_outofcatalog.py` (fixture 19). |
| **Claim pin-compatible / pin-incompatible / single BOM total / stock status as facts** | All of these need a vendor source + range (e.g. "$6–8 passive track / $11–15 active track, verify with distributor"). |
| **Always download the datasheet PDF for a single headline spec** | Use the **HTML-first fast path** (Tier 3 step 3d): product pages expose 3-7 headline specs in 5-10 s; only fall back to full PDF when the parameter needs the electrical-characteristics table. |
| **Write a 1000-word essay when 3 bullets + table would do** | Lead with the comparison table; prose supports the table, not the other way around. |
| **Block with 5 questions before recommending anything** | Default to a reasonable assumption, state it, and proceed (see Step 5); only ask when the cost of being wrong is high (AEC-Q100, FDA, regulatory locking). |
| **"Read the datasheet at <URL> to compare"** / leave spec values blank for the user to fill in | Fetch the datasheet, extract the spec, cite URL + timestamp. Only mark `not verified` after mirrors have been tried. |

## When to Trigger

This skill triggers when the user mentions any of:

- **Embedded systems**: MCU, SoC, RTOS, firmware, drivers, BSP, HAL
- **Electronic products**: smart devices, IoT, wearables, robots, sensors
- **Technical solutions**: BOM, system design, component selection, vendor comparison
- **Chips / ICs**: microcontroller, processor, BLE, WiFi, motor driver, power management
- **Hardware design**: schematic, PCB, datasheet, reference design
- **Datasheets**: datasheet, spec sheet, data sheet
- **Firmware**: firmware, driver, SDK, middleware, BSP
- **Development boards**: dev kit, evaluation board, starter kit (when used for embedded design)

### Do NOT trigger for

- Pure software/learning questions (e.g., "how to write Hello World in Rust on ESP32")
- General programming (Python, JavaScript, algorithms)
- Web / cloud / database questions
- Math / theory without hardware context

## Core Principle

**All chip parameters come from official sources only.**
Never use pre-filled hardcoded specs. Every parameter must be verified against:
1. The chip's official datasheet PDF (downloaded to `embedded_dev/<vendor>/datasheet/`)
2. The official vendor product page on the vendor's website

**Critical distinction:**
- **Descriptive text** (e.g., "optimized for low power") = NOT a specification.
- **Tables with Min/Typ/Max columns** = specification. These are the only acceptable numerical sources.
- **Product page bullet lists** = often descriptive. Prefer datasheet tables for numerical values.

## Search Priority

When looking up chip data, BOM candidates, or reference designs, **always follow this 4-tier order — cheapest source first**. **Stop at the first tier that yields a usable answer for each parameter.** Do not keep fetching once a tier is sufficient.

| Tier | Source | When to use | Cost / speed | Install mode |
|------|--------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **1** | `specs/<Vendor>/<Part>.yaml` | First stop. Use a YAML field if it covers the parameter you need. Stop here if the field is present and the YAML's `link_status` is `verified_...` or `partial_verified_...`. | Fastest, zero network | Only if **specs plug-in** is installed |
| **2** | `embedded_dev/<vendor>/datasheet/<Part>_datasheet.pdf` | When Tier 1 is missing the field, or the YAML is a placeholder, or the YAML's `link_status` is `placeholder_...` and you need the actual datasheet body to fill the gap. The local PDF is a **trustworthy mirror** — do NOT re-fetch from the vendor URL once you have it locally. | Local PDF read (pdfplumber); zero network once installed | Only if **datasheets plug-in** is installed |
| **3** | `references/semiconductor-vendor/<Vendor>/product_families.md` + vendor URL fetch | Always available (built into the skill). Two sub-steps: (a) read the row for vendor URL + verification status, (b) follow the URL to fetch the datasheet / product page if you need actual spec values. Use this when Tier 1/2 are not installed OR do not cover the parameter. | Local file read for (a); network fetch for (b) | Always |
| **4** | Other reliable data sources | When Tiers 1–3 do not cover the parameter. Includes external datasheet mirrors (overseas: AllDatasheet → Mouser → Digi-Key → Reichelt → vendor site; domestic CN vendors: vendor CN site → LCSC → HQChip → Szlcsc → Semiee → OSHWHUB); plus any vendor or distributor URL surfaced in search but not in `references/`. | Network | Always |

**Rules**:

- **Stop early. The first tier that fully answers the question is the end.** Don't continue fetching to "double-check" or to gather extra data the user didn't ask for.
- Always cite the tier + URL/file anchor + timestamp. No "I remembered it" facts.
- **Tier 1 is conditional on the verified marker + recency.** Don't blindly trust every YAML field — some are placeholders or stale. For placeholder fields, the field is treated as missing and you fall through to Tier 2 (local datasheet) or Tier 3 (vendor URL).
- **Tier 2 is offline-first**: if the datasheets plug-in is installed, the local PDF is authoritative for that part. Re-fetching the vendor URL is wasted network and risks getting a different revision than what's already on disk.
- Tier 3 is two-step: read the `product_families.md` row for the URL/status, then fetch the URL for actual values when needed. Don't skip step 3b just because you found the URL — fetch the spec.
- Tier 4 is region-aware: domestic-CN mirrors first for GigaDevice / WCH / GD / QH / Nation Tech / HDSC; overseas mirrors first for ST / TI / Nordic / NXP / Renesas / Silicon Labs / Espressif.
- If Tier 4 is needed, return to Step 6 output template — only the source depth changes, the format stays the same.
- **Dual install modes** (public release without plug-ins vs dev clone / with plug-ins) are handled transparently: each tier is independently conditional on the relevant plug-in being installed.

**Per-parameter, not per-chip**: Each spec field (RAM, flash, current, ...) goes through the 4 tiers independently. A chip may have RAM verified from Tier 1 YAML, flash from Tier 2 local datasheet, core count from Tier 3 product_families.md, and pricing from Tier 4 distributor — that's normal and the citation format should make each tier explicit.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand the Application

1. Identify the **target application** (e.g., "smart ring", "robot joint", "smart glasses").
2. Identify **key requirements**:
   - Wireless (BLE / WiFi / NFC / LoRa)?
   - Processing power (Cortex-M0+ vs M33 vs M7)?
   - Power consumption (battery life target)?
   - Sensors (IMU, PPG, temperature, etc.)?
   - Size / cost / BOM constraints?
3. Identify **constraints**: battery powered, IP rating, operating temp range, regulatory.

### Step 2: Check Application Solution Index

Read `references/application-solution/INDEX.md` (auto-generated by `scripts/build_application_index.py`):

- **If a matching solution exists** → go to Step 3
- **If no matching solution exists** → pick one of three options based on cost:
  - **Option A — fetch + cite inline (default, recommended)**. For a one-shot comparison or quick list, generate the answer directly using the Tier 1–4 search path (Step 4) and present it as a comparison table with citations — exactly as Step 6 would. **Do not** create a new solution.md unless the user explicitly asks. Citations may reference `references/application-solution/INDEX.md#<related>` when a sibling solution informs the BOM. This is now the default path because v0.4.4+ capability-driven fetches (3d HTML-first, 3c Tier A/B/C) make in-session lookup both fast and reliable.
  - **Option B — curate a new solution file** (only when justified). Promote to `references/application-solution/<topic>/solution.md` when (a) the application recurs across many user requests, or (b) the user explicitly says "save this for reuse" / "start a new reference design". Follow the structure of an existing solution (Overview / BOM Candidates / Reference Designs / Selection Matrix / Verification Status); run every BOM spec through Step 4 once and anchor each cell with a tier marker.
  - **Option C — disambiguate** (last resort). Ask **one** targeted question only when none of the 7 default dimensions (Step 5) can be assumed. Otherwise default silently per the Step 5 reversible-cost rule.

### Step 3: Read Solution Document

For each existing solution, `solution.md` contains:

1. **Overview** — application context, key requirements
2. **BOM Candidates** — chips grouped by function (BLE SoC, sensor, power, etc.), with vendor + part number + verification status
3. **Reference Designs** — vendor-provided reference designs that match this application
4. **Selection Matrix** — trade-off table with recommendations
5. **Verification Status** — which BOM specs have been verified against vendor datasheets

### Step 4: Verify Each BOM Component (fetch, don't punt)

**Principle**: the skill exists to deliver verified chip specs to the user. **The skill fetches datasheets itself; the user should never have to read a 300-page PDF just to compare two BLE SoCs.** If a parameter is in any catalogue or datasheet, the skill extracts it; the user gets a filled-in comparison table, not a list of links.

**Stop-early rule** (per the Search Priority section above): walk the 4 tiers in order — Tier 1 specs → Tier 2 local datasheet → Tier 3 product_families + vendor URL → Tier 4 external mirrors — and **stop at the first tier that yields a usable answer for the parameter you need**. Don't continue fetching to "double-check" or to gather extra data the user didn't ask for.

**v0.4.3 — Out-of-catalog escalation** (added 2026-07-02; see Anti-patterns "Drop out-of-catalog parts" for the rule, and `scripts/test_outofcatalog.py` fixture 19 for the end-to-end regression on a 17-row BLE SoC comparison).

For each candidate chip and each parameter you need, evaluate the tiers in order:

1. **Tier 1 — `specs/<Vendor>/<Part>.yaml`** (only if specs plug-in is installed). YAML field present AND `link_status` is `verified_...` or `partial_verified_...` → use as-is, cite YAML anchor + verification date; **stop here**. Field missing or `link_status` is `placeholder_...` → treat as missing, fall through.

2. **Tier 2 — `embedded_dev/<vendor>/datasheet/<Part>_datasheet.pdf`** (only if datasheets plug-in is installed). The local PDF is a **trustworthy mirror** — do NOT re-fetch from vendor once it is local. Cite the local PDF path + page number; **stop here**.

3. **Tier 3 — `references/semiconductor-vendor/<Vendor>/product_families.md` + vendor URL fetch**. Always available.
   - 3a. Read the catalogue row for URL + verification status (✅/⏳/❌).
   - 3b. If the row's status alone answers the question (e.g. part NRND), stop here.
   - **3c. PDF body fetch (capability-driven)** — pick the highest-capability tool the agent has, in this preference order:
     - **Tier A — server-side repair**: `tavily_extract extract_depth=advanced` / Firecrawl scrape / Jina Reader. URL-in, markdown-out; transparently fixes truncated downloads.
     - **Tier B — direct PDF + local parse**: HTTP-fetch the PDF to a temp path, then parse with `pdfplumber` / `pdftotext` / any other available PDF parser.
     - **Tier C — broken / unknown**: fall through to Tier 4 mirrors; if those also fail, walk the catalogue row instead.
     - **Don't claim a result you couldn't parse**: one retry on a different tool, then `not verified — PDF parse failed`. Never infer.
   - **3d. HTML-first fast path (⭐, preferred over 3c)** — vendor product pages (`renesas.com/<part>`, `st.com/.../`, `nxp.com/products/`) render headline specs without a 35 MB PDF. Pick the highest-capability URL→markdown tool the agent has, in this preference order:
     - **Tier 1**: any tool that does `URL → clean markdown` (e.g. `web_fetch extractMode=markdown`, Firecrawl MCP, Jina Reader)
     - **Tier 2**: keyword-routed page extraction (`tavily_extract extract_depth=basic`, `web_fetch text` + HTML-strip)
     - **Tier 3**: raw HTTP body (`exec curl | head -2000`) — cite as `[#] unstructured`
     - **Tier 4 (none)**: fall through to 3c
     - **Do NOT use a `web_search` / keyword-search tool as a URL fetcher** — snippets, not page body.
   - **3d CAN answer**: status badge, top-line (core / freq / RAM / Flash), voltage range, package list, temp grade, wireless version, **headline** low-power current (feature-rank only).
   - **3d CANNOT answer**: Min/Typ/Max electrical tables, register maps, mechanical drawings, custom SKU variants — fall through to 3c.
   - **3d → 3c fallback**: if Tier 1/2 markdown lacks the parameter, do NOT retry the same URL on a lower tier — fall through to 3c immediately. Don't ping the same URL twice.
   - **Truncated-PDF repair**: if 3c Tier B returns EOF / 0-byte / garbled, fall back to 3c Tier A (server-side repair). Verified pattern, see MEMORY.md 2026-07-01.
   - **Cost**: 3d typical 5-10 s + 1 MB; 3c typical 30-90 s + 6-35 MB. HTML-first saves 1-2 min/part for headline-only comparisons.
   - Citation examples: `(240 MHz, renesas.com/da14706 (URL → markdown @ tier 1), 2026-07-04 13:13 GMT+8, [D-HTML @ tier 1])` — treat `[D-HTML]` as `[#]` for ranking; promote to `[D]` after datasheet-table cross-check.

4. **Tier 4 — External datasheet mirrors** (after Tiers 1–3 exhausted). Try in order, stop at first hit.
   - **Overseas** parts: AllDatasheet → Mouser (`pdfDocs/`, `datasheet/2/389/`) → Digi-Key → Reichelt → vendor site (last resort, often Cloudflare-gated).
   - **Domestic CN** parts (GigaDevice / WCH / GD / QH / Nation Tech / HDSC): vendor CN site → LCSC → HQChip → Szlcsc → Semiee → OSHWHUB.
   - **Fallback rules**: if one mirror 404s or returns HTML, log + try the next. If the vendor site is Cloudflare-gated (st.com, silabs.com), do NOT retry it — go straight to mirrors. If all mirrors fail → `not verified` + give up.

5. **Cite every parameter** with tier + source + timestamp. Examples:
   - `[D]` Tier 2: `embedded_dev/nordic/datasheet/nRF52832_datasheet.pdf p.12, verified 2026-06-28`
   - `[#]` Tier 3 product page: `references/.../product_families.md#<part>, vendor URL fetched 2026-07-04`
   - `[D-HTML @ tier N]` Tier 3d product page: vendor URL, fetch timestamp
   - `[D] Tier 4 mirror`: `<mirror URL> p.12 datasheet rev 1.1, fetched 2026-06-27`

6. **If a parameter truly cannot be confirmed from any tier** (no YAML field, datasheets plug-in not installed, catalogue row incomplete, all mirrors failed) → mark `not verified` + state what you tried across tiers: `tried specs/ (no YAML), tried embedded_dev/ (plug-in not installed), tried product_families.md (no row), tried 6 mirrors (alldatasheet no match, mouser no PDF, lcsc 404, vendor Cloudflare) — give up; see vendor URL`. Never invent a value.

### Step 5: Handle Uncertainty — Defaults First, Confirm Only When Reversible-Cost Is High

**Principle**: default to a reasonable assumption and proceed. The user came for a chip pick, not a questionnaire. Only stop to confirm when the cost of being wrong is high and irreversible.

**Decision rule** (apply per ambiguity dimension):

| Reversible-cost level | When | Skill behaviour |
|------------------------|------|------------------|
| **Low** (user can swap chip after seeing BOM cost) | Cost-sensitive product, prototype, hobby project | **Pick the conservative middle option silently. State assumption. Move on.** |
| **Medium** (swap = a few days of PCB rework) | Production design, mixed wireless, unknown volume | **Pick a sensible default, but flag as a confirm-once gate.** |
| **High** (swap = new certification, respin, $$$ tooling) | AEC-Q100 automotive, FDA medical, ATEX, regulatory-locked | **Ask the 1 most binding question before proceeding.** No default. |

**Always state the assumption** so the user can override. Format: `*[Assumed: BLE 5.x; tell me if you need Wi-Fi or Thread.]*`

**Do not ask questions when you can pick a sensible default.** The 7 ambiguity dimensions below all have a default:

| Dimension | Default if user is silent | Override trigger |
|-----------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Power source | Li-Po, days–weeks | User says coin cell / USB / mains |
| Wireless protocol | BLE only | User mentions Wi-Fi, Thread, LoRa, cellular, or "no wireless" |
| BOM cost target | Balanced $5–20 | User says "cheap", "premium", or quotes a target |
| Sourcing preference | Domestic-friendly (mixed OK) | User says "China-domestic only" / "overseas only" |
| Operating environment | Indoor consumer 0–40°C | User says industrial / automotive / outdoor / extreme |
| Regulatory / certification | CE/FCC | User names SRRC / TELEC / KC / UL etc. |
| Production volume | 1k–100k | User says prototype / hobby / mass production |

**Only escalate to a question** when cost-of-being-wrong is **High** (AEC-Q100, FDA, ATEX), user said "ask me before assuming", or three defaults in a row contradict each other (USB-powered + 5-year battery + outdoor). **Ask one decision at a time** with enumerated a/b/c options (typically: wireless protocol + operating environment first). Don't batch 5 questions.

**If user says "you decide"**: pick the conservative middle default, state it, and proceed.

**Examples**:

*Low cost, default + state*: `"BLE 5.x single-chip (assumed; tell me if you need Wi-Fi/Thread)"` → Step 6 immediately.
*Medium cost, confirm-once*: `"Proceeding with (b) Li-Po + balanced cost; re-rank if your volume is <1k or >100k."`
*High cost, ask 1*: `"Automotive (-40..+125°C, AEC-Q100) — grade 2 (≤105°C Tj) or grade 1 (≤125°C Tj)? Changes the candidate list."`

### Step 6: Provide Solution — Top 3 + Comparison

By default, recommend the **top 3 most suitable candidates** with an explicit comparison, not a single pick. The user makes the final trade-off decision. Adapt the depth to the request: a quick "which BLE SoC?" can be 3 short bullets; a full BOM design should be a multi-row comparison table.

For each candidate in the top 3, output:

1. **Chip name and vendor product page URL** (from `references/semiconductor-vendor/<Vendor>/product_families.md`).
2. **Key parameters — already fetched by the skill** (cores, flash, RAM, wireless version, key current/voltage, package). Each value should carry a citation like `(32 KB RAM, p.12 datasheet rev 1.1, fetched 2026-06-27 from mouser.com/pdfDocs/stm32wb55cc.pdf)`. If a parameter could not be fetched, mark `not verified — tried st.com (Cloudflare), mouser/pdfDocs (no PDF), alldatasheet (no match)` so the user knows what was attempted. Do NOT leave the user to read the PDF themselves — that defeats the purpose of the skill.
3. **Why it's suitable** for the target application (1–2 sentences tied to the user's stated requirements).
4. **Trade-offs** vs the other two candidates (1–2 sentences — e.g. "lower cost but no integrated PMU").

Then include a **comparison table** spanning all three:

| Criterion | Candidate A | Candidate B | Candidate C |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Vendor | ... | ... | ... |
| Key params (cores / flash / RAM / BLE ver) | ... | ... | ... |
| Fit for user's top 3 requirements | ... | ... | ... |
| Main trade-off | ... | ... | ... |
| Verification status | ✅ / ⏳ / ❌ / partial | ... | ... |

End with a **Source** line: link to each vendor's `product_families.md` entry and cite the datasheet page numbers used for verification.

**When fewer than 3 candidates are appropriate** (e.g. the BOM function has only 1–2 viable parts in the catalogue), present what exists and say so explicitly — do NOT pad with weak candidates to hit 3.

### Step 7: External / Out-of-Scope Lookup (after Tier 4 exhausted)

If Step 2 finds **no matching application-solution** AND Step 4's four-tier search (Tier 1 specs → Tier 2 local datasheet → Tier 3 product_families + vendor URL → Tier 4 external mirrors) has not surfaced a usable candidate, widen the search. Use the **cheapest source that can actually answer the question** — don't burn a web search when a vendor page will do.

This step is **after** the Search Priority 4-tier system has been fully walked. It is the last-resort fallback, not a substitute for Tier 4.

Escalate in this order, stopping at the first source that yields a usable answer:

1. **Vendor-published reference designs already linked from this skill** — `references/semiconductor-vendor/<Vendor>/system-solutions/` (single-vendor reference designs, see INDEX.md). Free, already curated.
2. **Third-party teardowns already linked from this skill** — `references/application-solution/<topic>/solution.md` "Third-party Sources" sections. Real-world observed BOMs.
3. **Web search** (e.g. `web_search` tool) — for the specific question ("DA14531 stock status 2026", "smart home gateway reference design"). Prefer vendor URLs and recognised distributors (Mouser, Digi-Key, LCSC) over forums.
4. **Component marketplaces** (Mouser, Digi-Key, LCSC) — for stock / price / lifecycle status when the user asks "can I buy it now?".
5. **Engineer community** (EEVblog, hackaday.io, element14) — for design intent and teardown observations when no official source covers it.

When you go outside the skill's curated files, **always cite the URL you used** so the user can verify. After widening the search, return to Step 6 (top 3 + comparison) — the output template does not change, only the source depth.

## Verification Before Responding

Before sending any result, run this checklist:

- [ ] Did I check `references/application-solution/INDEX.md` first?
- [ ] Does every chip in the BOM have a vendor product page URL from `references/semiconductor-vendor/<Vendor>/product_families.md`?
- [ ] Is every numerical parameter from a vendor datasheet (not from memory)?
- [ ] For any parameter I cannot find → did I explicitly write "not verified"?
- [ ] If the application has constraints I don't know → did I ask the user?
- [ ] Did I provide top 3 candidates with a comparison table (Step 6), not a single pick?
- [ ] If I went outside this skill's files (Step 7), did I cite the URL?
- [ ] For each parameter, did I follow the **4-tier Search Priority** and stop at the first tier that fully answers it? Citation should show which tier (Tier 1 specs YAML verified + recent / Tier 2 local datasheet / Tier 3 product_families.md + vendor URL fetch / Tier 4 external mirror).
